### Project Overview

 The Primetime Emmy Award is an American award bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. They are considered television's equivalent to the Academy Awards(Oscars). In this project we will try to do some POS analysis on the show/series nominees over the years.

### Project Overview

 Have you ever wondered how google autocorrects your spelling and offers accurate suggestions?

When you search anything on the google and you did spelling mistack, it will autoimatically show you the correct spelling or phrase you want to search.

Example: If you search for the artificial intelligence. Instead of doing this you wrote the spelling artificial intelligancnce it will automatically shows you this messgae (Showing results for artificial intelligence , Search instead for artificial intelligancnce. but how does google do that in this project we are going to learn how to built the spell checker using the sets of words.

Before we go any further, first let's understand the problem. The various cases of errors are:

The misspelt word has no meaning. Example typing acrss instead of across (Non-Word Error (NWE))
The misspelt word has meaning thought not what the user originally intended. Example typing feed when you actually wanted to type freed (Real Word Error (RWE))
For the purpose of this error, we will deal with the first kind of errors only i.e. user has misspelt the word in such a way that the misspelt word does not exist in the dictionary. Here you are working on 0643.xml file, which consists of lots of words and phrases. Based on this file we will check the list of posssible word and display the correct predicted word.

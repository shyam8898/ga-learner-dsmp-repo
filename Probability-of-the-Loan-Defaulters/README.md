### Project Overview

 For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.


### Learnings from the project

 Concepts of  probability and conditional probability and some visualisation for probability


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I just followed the steps given, and whenever there was error I always take help from python documentation
